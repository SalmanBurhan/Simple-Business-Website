			    A Simple Business Website
				By: Salman Burhan


I got bored, so I started designing something, I didn't know what, I'm not really sure how it got to being a Business Site, but whateverâ€¦

Requirements:

1. MySQL
2. Apache WebServer
3. PHP 5
4. Access to phpMyAdmin or any other MySQL Viewer
5. Text Editor Of Some sort.


Installation:

1. With a text editor open inc/config.php

2. Change The Settings. Google Maps, Image/Logo, and the Copyright Text

3. Go To phpMyAdmin, create a database with the name of your choice, then import the database.sql file located at inc/database.sql.

4. Insert Your Data Into The Table.

5. Edit inc/Meta.php and insert any keywords you want, and a description. if you don't want any of those, remove those lines, NOT the file!! You NEED the top few lines of the page.

6. Place Your Own Image/Logo In The inc/img folder with the name you chose in step 1 and 2.

7. Edit the inc/MySQL.inc.php file to fit your MySQL database.

8. Launch the site. Check it out, test it out.



If you have any ideas, or changes, run it by me, submit a pull request. I'll check it out.

You Can Use Bing Maps, or any other map that can be linked to a site instead of Google Maps.

The Index.html with the loading bar doesn't do anything. I added it just to look good, if you like it, keep it, otherwise you can just remove it and rename site.php to index.php.

Enjoy! :D :P :)
